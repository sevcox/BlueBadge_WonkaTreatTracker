            <h4>
               Welcome to the Wonka Treat Tracker! An application for logging and tracking your delicious inventory.
            </h4>
            <p>
                After your hire date you will be assigned to a factory. Please register with the factory id you were provided during orientation.
                After logging in you will use this app to enter in inventory of the treats in your factory.
                After entry you may assign those treats to a store for tracking purposes. You will also use this to track down candies in case of a recall or a secret ingredient scandal.
                Beware of our indentured servants (aka characters)... you may track them as well in order to prevent the spread of our secret ingredients.
                Now get to work my dear oompa loompa!
