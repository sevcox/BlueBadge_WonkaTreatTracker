            <h4>Welcome to the Wonka Treat Tracker! An application for loggin and tracking your inventory.</h4>
            <p>
                After you hire date you will be given a factory Id. Please register with the factoory id you were provided during orientation.
                After logging in you will use the app to enter in inventory of the treats in your factory.
                After entry you may assign those treats to a store for tracking purposes. You will also use thi to track down candies in case of product recalls or secret ingredient scandal.
                Beware of our indentured servants (aka characters).. you may track them as well in order to prevent the spread of our secret ingredients. Now dear oompa loompa, GET TO WORK!
